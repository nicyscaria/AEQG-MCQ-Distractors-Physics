It includes the special theory of relativity, which describes how time and space change for objects moving at high speeds, and the general theory of relativity, which explains how massive objects distort space-time. Relativity has profound implications for understanding the universe, from black holes to the Big Bang.",,,,,,,,
OS_PH_HS_01_01_06,OS_PH_HS_01_01,OS_PH_HS_01,OS_PH_HS,History of Physics,"Physics began with ancient civilizations observing natural phenomena like celestial motion and forces, laying the groundwork for understanding mechanics and astronomy. The Greeks, especially Aristotle and Archimedes, formalized these observations into early theories of natural philosophy and mechanics. During the Islamic Golden Age, scholars like Alhazen advanced optics and motion.

The Renaissance marked a rebirth of physics, with Galileo introducing experimentation and Newton unifying mechanics with his laws of motion and universal gravitation in the 17th century. This era of classical physics explained everyday phenomena and fueled technological advancements like steam engines during the Industrial Revolution.

In the 19th century, Faraday and Maxwell revolutionized electromagnetism, revealing the nature of light as an electromagnetic wave. At the same time, the study of heat and energy gave rise to thermodynamics, with practical applications in engines and refrigeration. Radioactivity and nuclear physics emerged, driven by the work of Marie Curie and others, revealing the structure of the atom.

The 20th century saw the rise of modern physics, with Einstein’s relativity redefining space, time, and gravity, and quantum mechanics explaining atomic and subatomic behavior. These breakthroughs led to transformative technologies like semiconductors, nuclear energy, and space exploration.

Today, physics continues to shape modern technology and our understanding of the universe, from particle physics to quantum computing and renewable energy.",,,,,,,,

It explains phenomena like why metal should not be placed in microwaves, how black radiators cool engines efficiently, and how GPS systems use speed, distance, and time to calculate routes, incorporating corrections from relativity.

In science, physics underpins disciplines like chemistry, biology, and geology. It explains atomic bonding, blood flow dynamics, and radioactive dating. Physics-based tools like X-rays, MRIs, and ultrasounds revolutionize medical diagnostics, while therapies like radiation treatment are rooted in nuclear physics.

Engineering relies heavily on physics. Civil engineers use it to design stable structures, electrical engineers apply electromagnetism to create modern electronics, and mechanical engineers use energy and motion principles to innovate engines and vehicles.

Space exploration, such as the Rosetta and Voyager missions, showcases the use of physics to navigate the cosmos, using gravitational slingshots and advanced propulsion systems. Renewable energy technologies, including solar panels and wind turbines, also rely on physics principles to address energy challenges.

It begins with observation of natural phenomena, leading to the formulation of questions or hypotheses. Scientists then collect and analyze data, often through controlled experiments, to test their hypotheses.

From the results, they develop models, theories, and laws that describe or predict the behavior of nature. These findings are communicated and subjected to peer review for validation. The scientific method emphasizes evidence, precision, and reproducibility, aiming to describe the universe as it is, rather than as we imagine it to be.",,,,,,,,
OS_PH_HS_01_02_02,OS_PH_HS_01_02,OS_PH_HS_01,OS_PH_HS,Model,"A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations - computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot observe with our senses, such as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds.

Models are always approximate, so they are simpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must be. Models put the intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.",,,,,,,,

This law states that the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun located at one of its two foci. This means that planetary orbits are not perfect circles but elongated paths.

Kepler’s Second Law (The Law of Equal Areas):
This law states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. As a result, planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun (at perihelion) and slower when they are farther away (at aphelion).

Kepler’s Third Law (The Law of Harmonies):
This law states that the square of a planet’s orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. It relates the time a planet takes to complete one orbit to its average distance from the Sun, showing that more distant planets take longer to orbit the Sun.

Longitudinal Waves: The disturbance is parallel to the wave’s direction of travel. Sound waves and pressure waves in gases and liquids are examples.

A periodic wave is a wave that repeats its oscillations in a consistent and continuous manner. Unlike pulse waves, periodic waves occur over multiple cycles, making them predictable. These waves are closely related to simple harmonic motion, where particles in the medium oscillate back and forth in a repeating pattern. Common examples of periodic waves include ocean waves, sound waves, and vibrating strings in musical instruments. The movement of water waves, for instance, causes objects on the surface, such as a seagull, to bob up and down in a regular pattern as crests and troughs pass by.

The crest of a wave is the highest point in the wave’s oscillation, representing the maximum upward displacement of the medium. In an ocean wave, the crest is the peak of the wave where water reaches its highest level.

The trough of a wave is the lowest point in the wave’s oscillation, representing the maximum downward displacement of the medium. In an ocean wave, the trough is the lowest dip between two crests.

Together, crests and troughs define the wave’s shape and motion, illustrating how energy moves through the medium in a continuous, periodic manner.","{

This occurs when two identical waves moving in opposite directions superimpose, creating alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference. As a result, some points, called nodes, remain still, while other points, called antinodes, oscillate with maximum amplitude.

Examples of Standing Waves:

On a Liquid Surface: Vibrations from a refrigerator motor can create standing waves in a glass of milk, where the liquid oscillates up and down without moving across the surface.

In Earthquakes: Seismic waves reflecting off denser rock layers can form standing waves, causing localized damage in some areas while leaving others relatively unaffected.

In Musical Instruments: Stringed instruments, such as guitars and violins, produce standing waves when the wave reflects off the fixed ends of the string, creating musical tones.","{

A disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion. 

As the string oscillates back and forth, part of the string’s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and lower pressures. The higher pressure regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are rarefactions. The pressure disturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the form of thermal energy transferred to the air. The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area.",,,"[

OS_PH_HS_14_01_02,OS_PH_HS_14_01,OS_PH_HS_14,OS_PH_HS,Speed of Sound,"The speed of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases.

Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it’s traveling to some extent, especially for gases.
Sound, like all waves, travels at certain speeds through different media and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. Sound travels much slower than light—we can observe this while watching a fireworks display, since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.
The relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves, speed of sound is the product of frequency and wavelength. 
The wavelength of a sound, therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength. The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

One of the most important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case, and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.","{

In cartoons showing a screaming person, the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula (the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth) to represent a loud sound coming from the throat. A useful quantity for describing the loudness of sounds is called sound intensity. In general, the intensity of a wave is the power per unit area carried by the wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. The SI unit for I is W/m^2. The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude. The intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so I varies as (_p)^2. The relationship with pressure amplitude is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed during the vibration. Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared.","{

OS_PH_HS_14_02_03,OS_PH_HS_14_02,OS_PH_HS_14,OS_PH_HS,Hearing and voice,"Hearing is the perception of sound. It can give us plenty of information—such as pitch, loudness, and direction. Humans can normally hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 45,000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to 110,000 Hz sounds. We have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.

Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. The perception of frequency is called pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness. The way we hear involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that hits our ear is a pressure wave. The ear converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone. 

The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the eardrum protected inside of the ear. The middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner ear via the oval window. Two muscles in the middle ear protect the inner ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage.","{

An example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when we are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to us, the more sudden the shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if we ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as we pass by.

Let's compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source, sound waves emitted by a moving source, and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by moving observers. In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted. If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become closer together in the direction in which it’s traveling and farther apart in the direction it’s traveling away from. Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving, and longer in the opposite direction. If the observers move, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency.

The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a sonic boom. A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.

An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail. During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive enough to break windows. Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.","{

The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate. 

In addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time.

OS_PH_HS_14_04_02,OS_PH_HS_14_04,OS_PH_HS_14,OS_PH_HS,Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics,"Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a standing wave in the tube.

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, and no displacement (a node) at the closed end. The motion is unconstrained at the antinode, and halted at the node. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; therefore, lambda = 4L . This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube.

Since maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the tube. Here the standing wave has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or L= (3/4) lambda(dash) , so that lambda(dash) = 4L/3 . There is a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube.

The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are multiples of the fundamental, and are called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second harmonic, and so on. The fundamental and overtones can be present at the same time in a variety of combinations.

Light, a type of EMR, reaches Earth from the Sun across millions of kilometers, supporting life by providing energy, heat, and weather patterns.

EM waves are generated when an electric charge moves, producing both an electric field (E) and a magnetic field (B). When the charge oscillates, as in an alternating current, an electromagnetic wave propagates outward. While visible light is the most familiar form of EMR, it is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.","{

Key Concepts from Maxwell’s Equations:
Electric Field and Charges: Electric fields originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges.
Magnetic Field Continuity: Magnetic field lines are continuous and have no beginning or end, meaning magnetic monopoles do not exist.
Induced Electric Fields: A changing magnetic field generates an electric field (basis for electromagnetic induction).
Moving Charges and Magnetic Fields: Moving electric charges or changing electric fields create magnetic fields.
Maxwell’s equations unified electricity and magnetism into a single force: the electromagnetic force. This understanding led to major advances in electromagnetic waves, wireless communication, and electrical engineering.","{

These behaviors include reflection, refraction, interference, and polarization. These properties help explain many real-world phenomena, from mirrors and lenses to rainbows and polarized sunglasses.

Types of EM Wave Behavior:
Reflection – Light bounces off a surface, following the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection). Seen in mirrors and shiny objects.
Refraction – Light bends when passing between different media due to a change in speed. This explains why objects appear distorted in water.
Interference – When waves overlap, they can combine (constructive interference) or cancel each other (destructive interference), leading to patterns like the colors seen in soap bubbles or oil slicks.
Polarization – Light waves can vibrate in multiple directions, but polarizing filters allow only one orientation to pass, reducing glare from surfaces like water or snow.
These behaviors explain optical effects, help in developing imaging technologies, and are widely used in communication and vision-based applications.","{

These relationships help us understand the behavior of light in space and various media, as well as its effects on brightness and illumination.

Key Concepts:

Speed of Light (c) – All electromagnetic waves travel at $3.00 \times 10^8$ m/s in a vacuum. Light from celestial objects takes time to reach Earth, meaning we see them as they existed in the past.

Wave Equation – The fundamental relationship between speed (c), frequency (f), and wavelength ($\lambda$).

Luminous Flux (P) – The total amount of visible light emitted from a source, measured in lumens (lm).

Illuminance (E) – The amount of light falling on a surface, measured in lux ($lm/m^2$). It follows the inverse square law, meaning illuminance decreases as distance increases.

These concepts are used in astronomy, lighting design, optics, and energy-efficient lighting technologies.","{

OS_PH_HS_16_01_01,OS_PH_HS_16_01,OS_PH_HS_16,OS_PH_HS,Characteristics of Mirrors,"Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a ray. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass).
Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called geometric optics. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter.
The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, Theta(r) , equals the angle of incidence, Theta(i). This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. The angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the normal line, or just the normal. Light reflected in this way is referred to as specular. 
We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces but how does a rough surface reflects light? Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is diffused. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.
We have curved mirrors: 
1. Concave mirror
2. Convex mirror

OS_PH_HS_16_02_01,OS_PH_HS_16_02,OS_PH_HS_16,OS_PH_HS,The Law of Refraction,"The changing of a light ray’s direction (loosely called bending) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called refraction. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers. 

Light changes speed when going from one material to another, therefore light changes its direction while passing from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the index of refraction, n, of a material to be
n= c / v ,
where v is the observed speed of light in the material. Because the speed of light is always less than c in matter and equals c only in a vacuum, the index of refraction (plural: indices of refraction) is always greater than or equal to one.

The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. The medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1. This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. 

The amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of refraction. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell’s law. The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the outgoing ray is called the refracted ray. The associated angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.","{

OS_PH_HS_16_02_03,OS_PH_HS_16_02,OS_PH_HS_16,OS_PH_HS,Total internal reflection and its applications,"A good-quality mirror reflects over 90% of incident light, but total reflection can be achieved through total internal reflection (TIR), a phenomenon related to refraction. When light passes from a medium with a higher refractive index ($n_1$) to one with a lower refractive index ($n_2$), the refracted ray bends away from the normal. As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction ($\theta_2$) also increases. The critical angle ($\theta_c$) is the incident angle at which the refracted ray is at 90°, skimming along the boundary. If the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, all light is reflected back into the original medium, causing TIR. This can only occur when $n_1 > n_2$.

TIR explains the sparkle of diamonds. The diamond-to-air critical angle is just $24.4^\circ$, making it difficult for light to escape. Light undergoes multiple internal reflections due to diamond facets, concentrating light at specific exit points and enhancing its brilliance.

Corner reflectors utilize TIR with two perpendicular reflecting surfaces, ensuring light is reflected back parallel to its original path, regardless of the incident angle. This principle is used in reflectors on bicycles, cars, and signs, as well as in binoculars and periscopes.

Fiber optics rely on TIR to transmit light signals for communication technologies like the internet and cable TV. Light entering the fiber strikes the internal surface at angles greater than the critical angle, ensuring it is totally reflected within the fiber. The fiber’s core has a higher refractive index than its cladding, which helps maintain TIR. Some fibers have graded refractive indices to enhance light guidance, allowing even sharp bends without loss of signal, effectively turning them into flexible “light pipes.”",,"{

OS_PH_HS_16_03_01,OS_PH_HS_16_03,OS_PH_HS_16,OS_PH_HS,Characteristics of Lenses,"A convex (converging) lens focuses parallel light rays to a single point called the focal point ($F$) on the opposite side. The central axis is the line normal to the lens at its center. A concave (diverging) lens causes parallel light rays to diverge as if they originate from a focal point on the same side as the incoming rays. The focal length ($f$) is the distance from the lens center to the focal point. For diverging lenses, $f$ is negative.

The power ($P$) of a lens is calculated as $P = \frac{1}{f}$, where $f$ is in meters. The unit of power is the diopter (D). If $f$ is negative (diverging lens), $P$ is also negative.

Ray tracing rules:
	1.	A ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the focal point ($F$) on the other side.
	2.	A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis appears to come from the focal point ($F$) on the same side.
	3.	A ray passing through the center of either lens does not change direction.
	4.	A ray entering a converging lens through the focal point exits parallel to the axis.
	5.	A ray heading toward the focal point on the opposite side of a diverging lens exits parallel to the axis.

To find an image, trace at least two rays from a point on the object. The intersection of refracted rays determines the image point. The image is real if rays actually converge and can be projected.

Real lenses cause aberrations, distortions due to lens size, material, or imperfections. Chromatic aberration occurs because the refractive index depends on wavelength, causing different colors to focus at different points. Mirrors do not have this issue as reflection is independent of wavelength.

Cases for image formation:
Case 1: When $d_o > f$ (object beyond focal length), and $f > 0$:
	•	A real image is formed.
	•	The image is inverted (negative orientation).
	•	Magnification: $-1 < m < 0$.
Case 2: When $d_o < f$ (object within focal length), and $f > 0$:
	•	A virtual image is formed.
	•	The image is upright (positive orientation).
	•	Magnification: $m > 1$.
Case 3: When $f < 0$ (diverging lens):
	•	A virtual image is formed.
	•	The image is upright (positive orientation).

OS_PH_HS_16_03_02,OS_PH_HS_16_03,OS_PH_HS_16,OS_PH_HS,Physics of the Eye,"The eye is a remarkable optical instrument capable of forming detailed, colorful images. Clear vision requires a real image to be projected onto the retina, a light-sensitive layer at a fixed distance from the lens. The cornea and lens act together as a single thin lens, with the lens adjusting its power to focus on objects at varying distances. The image center falls on the fovea, which has the highest density of light receptors and provides sharp vision. The blind spot, where the optic nerve connects to the eye, lacks receptors, making it insensitive to light. The pupil regulates light entry, enabling the eye to detect light intensities ranging over $10^{10}$ times without damage. The optic nerve transmits visual signals from the retina to the brain for processing.

Refractive indices play a crucial role in image formation. The most significant refraction occurs at the cornea due to the change in light speed from air to cornea, contributing about two-thirds of the eye’s magnification. The lens provides the remaining magnification to form an image on the retina. Although light passes through multiple layers (cornea, aqueous humor, lens layers, vitreous humor), the system behaves like a single convex lens. Images formed on the retina are inverted, but the brain processes them to appear upright.

Common vision defects include:
	1.	Nearsightedness (myopia): Difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. The eye overconverges parallel rays from distant objects, causing them to focus in front of the retina. Rays from nearby objects are more divergent and focus correctly on the retina. Myopia is corrected with a diverging (concave) lens, which reduces the eye’s power by increasing the effective focal length, allowing distant objects to focus on the retina.
	2.	Farsightedness (hyperopia): Difficulty seeing close objects clearly. The eye underconverges rays from close objects, so they do not focus on the retina. Less divergent rays from distant objects can be focused properly. Hyperopia is corrected with a converging (convex) lens, increasing the eye’s power to compensate for the longer focal length, enabling close objects to focus on the retina.

The lens power ($P$) is calculated using $P = \frac{1}{f}$, where $f$ is the focal length in meters, and the unit is diopters (D). Corrections for myopia involve negative diopters (diverging lenses), while hyperopia corrections use positive diopters (converging lenses).","{

We have the following kinds of images:
Case 1:

When the object distance is greater than the focal length (d_0 > f), and f is positive:

A real image is formed
The image is inverted (negative)
The magnification (m) is between -1 and 0 (i.e., -1 < m < 0)

Case 2:

When the object distance is less than the focal length (d_0 < f), and f is positive:

A virtual image is formed
The image is upright (positive)
The magnification is greater than 1 (m > 1)

Case 3:

When the focal length is negative (f < 0):

A virtual image is formed
The image is upright (positive)
The magnification is less than 1 (0 < m < 1)


These are the steps to follow when solving a lens problem:
Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is involved.
Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin-lens equations, or both should be used. A sketch is very helpful even if ray tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write useful symbols and values on the sketch.
Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).
Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to determine whether the situation involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. Although these are just names for types of images, they have certain characteristics that can be of great use in solving problems.
Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray-tracing rules listed earlier in this section.
Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin-lens equations. These equations are solved in the usual manner by substituting knowns and solving for unknowns. Several worked examples were included earlier and can serve as guides.
Step 7. Check whether the answer is reasonable. Does it make sense? If you identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3) correctly, you should assess whether your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on.

The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic that occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for a phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is produced by waves. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits is evidence that light has the properties of a wave.
When light passes through narrow slits, it is diffracted into semicircular waves.

To understand the basis of such calculations, consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they will end up out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively. If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively. More generally, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any half-integral number of wavelengths (__/2, 3__/2, 5__/2, etc.), then destructive interference occurs.

2. Some barcode scanners use a laser beam.
3. Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals.
4. Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance.
5. Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means entire picture (from the Greek holo-, as in holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser beam.
6. One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding.
7. Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length.
8. An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a diffraction grating. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction. A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal or CD.","{

OS_PH_HS_17_02_03,OS_PH_HS_17_02,OS_PH_HS_17,OS_PH_HS,Calculations Involving Diffraction Gratings and Resolution,"The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As we know from the double slits in Young’s double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle theta relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled. Each ray travels a distance that differs by dsin(theta) from that of its neighbor, where d is the distance between slits. If dsin(theta) equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is
dsin(theta) = ____,for __=0,1,_1,2,_2,…,
where d is the distance between slits in the grating, __ is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the maximum. Note that this is exactly the same equation as for two slits separated by d. However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles. 

Consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it. It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter D, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at __=1.22__/__ , provided that the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. The first minimum is at an angle of __=1.22__/__ ,","{

They discovered electrons as carriers of negative charge through cathode ray experiments.

Thomson's ""plum pudding"" model of the atom was later disproven by Rutherford's gold foil experiments, which revealed the atomic nucleus containing protons (positive charge carriers).

Conductors, like metals (copper, silver, and aluminum), have loosely bound outer electrons that enable easy charge movement with minimal energy required. In contrast, insulators such as plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood have atoms and molecules that hold their electrons tightly, making charge movement difficult and potentially destructive to the material if forced. 

Between these two categories lie semiconductors, like silicon, which can be made conductive under specific conditions of temperature, purity, and applied force, making them crucial in computer chip manufacturing. When excess negative charge is placed on a conducting object, the charges repel each other and spread evenly across its outer surface. However, in insulators, the excess charge remains fixed in its original position due to the material's resistance to charge movement.

Charge transfer can occur through different methods: charging by contact, where electrons transfer between materials through surface contact or rubbing, and charging by conduction, where excess electrons redistribute themselves across conducting surfaces to maximize their separation due to repulsion.

Polarization is another significant process in charge transfer, where excess charges on one part of an object cause a redistribution of charges throughout the body without actual electron movement between distant points. This principle is demonstrated when charging by induction occurs, where a charged object can create an unbalanced charge in a nearby neutral object through attraction and repulsion of existing charges, leading to charge separation when the objects are physically separated while under the influence of the inducing charge.","{

Using his innovative torsion balance device, Coulomb discovered that the force is proportional to the charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance.

This inverse-square law shares similarities with Newton's law of universal gravitation but differs in two key aspects: Coulomb's constant is much larger than the gravitational constant, and electric charges can be both positive and negative, resulting in either attractive or repulsive forces, while gravity is only attractive. The law applies to stationary charged objects and is most easily applied to spherical objects or those much smaller than their separation distance.","{

For a point charge or uniformly charged sphere, the electric field magnitude follows an inverse square relationship (E = kQ/r_).

The direction and strength of electric fields can be visualized using field lines, which point away from positive charges and toward negative charges, with their density indicating field strength. For multiple charges, the total electric field is the sum of individual fields, and field lines never cross.

Just as a mass has gravitational potential energy in Earth's gravitational field, a charge has electric potential energy in an electric field. When a charge moves in an electric field, its potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy, enabling it to perform work. The change in electric potential energy (_UE) equals the negative of the work done by the electric field (_qE(xf_xi)), where q is the charge, E is the electric field strength, and xf_xi represents the displacement.

This principle parallels gravitational potential energy, where the change (_UG) equals _mgh. In both cases, as objects (charges or masses) move in their respective fields, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases, following the law of conservation of energy. The main difference lies in the source of the force: electric charge for electric potential energy and mass for gravitational potential energy.","{

The energy required to separate these charges comes from the battery's chemical potential energy and is stored in the electric field between the plates.

The capacitance (C) of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of charge magnitude (Q) to potential difference (V) between plates (C = Q/V), measured in farads (F). For a parallel-plate capacitor, the capacitance depends on the plate area (A), separation distance (d), and the permittivity of free space (__), following the equation C_ = __A/d.

This polarization weakens the electric field between the plates as the molecular charges partially cancel the plate charges.

The presence of a dielectric increases a capacitor's capacitance by a factor _ (kappa), known as the dielectric constant (C = ___A/d = _C_), where _ varies by material (e.g., 1 for vacuum, 80 for water).

If the terminals are connected by a conducting wire, an electric current (charges) will flow. Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end). Electric current is the rate at which electric charge moves. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount very quickly, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge more slowly. Current that moves constantly in a single direction. This is called direct current, because the electric charge flows in only one direction. Direct current is often called DC current.
Many sources of electrical power, such as the hydroelectric dam shown at the beginning of this chapter, produce alternating current, in which the current direction alternates back and forth. Alternating current is often called AC current. Alternating current moves back and forth at regular time intervals. The alternating current that comes from a normal wall socket does not suddenly switch directions. Rather, it increases smoothly up to a maximum current and then smoothly decreases back to zero. It then grows again, but in the opposite direction until it has reached the same maximum value. After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again.","{

These factors create a resistance to the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component opposes the flow of charge through it. Current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor. The constant of proportionality is the resistance R of the material. V= IR, this relationship is called Ohm’s law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage being the cause and the current being the effect. Ohm’s law is an empirical law like that for friction, which means that it is an experimentally observed phenomenon. The units of resistance are volts per ampere, or V/A. We call a V/A an ohm. Ohm’s law holds for most materials and at common temperatures. At very low temperatures, resistance may drop to zero (superconductivity). At very high temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms in the material inhibits the flow of electrons, increasing the resistance. The many substances for which Ohm’s law holds are called ohmic. Ohmic materials include good conductors like copper, aluminum, and silver, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. The resistance of ohmic materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current.","{

The tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same. Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating V of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively. Although the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each resistor. 

The equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this, imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.

A general approach to find the equivalent resistor for any arbitrary combination of resistors:
1. Identify a group of resistors that are only in parallel or only in series.
2. For resistors in series, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. For resistors in parallel, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance.
3. Draw a new circuit diagram with the resistors from step 1 replaced by their equivalent resistor.
4. If more than one resistor remains in the circuit, return to step 1 and repeat. Otherwise, you are finished.","{

These poles are classified as north (the end that points northward when freely suspended) and south, with like poles repelling and unlike poles attracting each other. Interestingly, Earth itself acts as a giant magnet, with its magnetic south pole near the geographic North Pole, explaining why the north pole of a compass needle points north.

Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, can be magnetized through exposure to external magnetic fields. On a microscopic level, these materials contain domains - regions where the magnetic poles of individual atoms are aligned like tiny bar magnets. When magnetized, these domains grow and align in the same direction, creating a permanent magnet. This magnetization can be disrupted by physical shock or heating above the material's Curie temperature, at which point the thermal energy randomizes the domain orientation.","{

The direction of magnetic field lines is defined by the direction a compass needle's north pole points - away from a magnet's north pole and toward its south pole. These field lines form complete loops, never stopping, and can be visualized using iron filings or by mapping with a small compass.

Beyond permanent magnets, magnetic fields can also be generated by electric currents, as discovered by Hans Christian Oersted. In a straight wire, the magnetic field forms concentric circles around the conductor, with its direction determined by the right-hand rule. When wire is coiled into a solenoid, it creates a magnetic field pattern similar to a bar magnet, with field strength proportional to the current and number of loops, and inversely proportional to the solenoid's length. This principle is utilized in electromagnets, which find applications in various technologies from MRI machines to particle accelerators.","{

The force direction can be determined using the right-hand rule: curling fingers from velocity to magnetic field vectors, with the thumb indicating the force direction. The force is maximum when motion is perpendicular to the field and zero when parallel.

For current-carrying wires in magnetic fields, the force follows a similar relationship: F = I_B sin _, where I is current, _ is wire length, and _ is the angle between current and field directions. This relationship demonstrates the fundamental connection between electricity and magnetism, as both moving charges and current-carrying conductors experience forces in magnetic fields, illustrating the symmetry of electromagnetic phenomena.","{

Electric motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy by utilizing the force (F = I_B sin _) exerted on current-carrying wires in magnetic fields. In a motor, current passing through wire loops in a magnetic field creates torque (_ = NIAB sin _), causing rotation. To maintain continuous rotation in one direction, the current is automatically reversed using brushes as the coil passes through specific angles.

Generators operate on the reverse principle, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. When a coil is mechanically rotated in a magnetic field, an EMF is induced following the equation E = NAB_ sin _t, where N is the number of turns, A is the coil area, B is the magnetic field strength, and _ is the angular velocity. This produces alternating current (AC), with the EMF oscillating between positive and negative maximum values, commonly used in household power systems at frequencies high enough to prevent noticeable flickering in electrical devices.

Transformers, essential for voltage conversion in power distribution, consist of primary and secondary coils wound around a ferromagnetic core. Based on Faraday's law of induction, they can step voltage up or down according to the transformer equation VS/VP = NS/NP, where the ratio of output to input voltage equals the ratio of secondary to primary coil turns. This principle enables efficient power transmission and allows electronic devices to operate at their required voltages from standard power outlets.","{

OS_PH_HS_20_02_02,OS_PH_HS_20_02,OS_PH_HS_20,OS_PH_HS,Transmission of Electrical Power,"Electrical power transmission across long distances relies heavily on transformers to manage voltage levels efficiently. Power plants use step-up transformers to increase voltage (up to 700 kV) before transmission, which allows for lower current flow and consequently reduces power losses due to wire resistance (Plost = I_transmittedRwire). This high-voltage transmission is crucial because the power transmitted remains constant (Ptransmitted = ItransmittedVtransmitted), while lower current minimizes heat-related energy losses in the transmission lines.

As electricity approaches population centers, the voltage is progressively stepped down through substations (to 5-30 kV) and finally to usable levels (120-480 V) for homes and businesses using step-down transformers. This multi-stage transformation system, based on Faraday's law of induction, enables efficient power distribution from generation facilities to end users while maintaining safety and minimizing energy losses throughout the grid.","{

This breakthrough came about 12 years after scientists first discovered that electric currents could create magnetic fields, revealing a fundamental symmetry in nature. The process, known as magnetic induction, occurs when there is relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor.

This principle revolutionized technology and forms the backbone of modern electrical power generation. From automobile alternators to nuclear power plants, magnetic induction is used to generate electricity. Faraday's experimental demonstration, moving a magnet through a wire coil to produce current, showed that the magnitude and direction of the induced current depend on the relative motion and orientation of the magnet. This discovery's practical applications extend to various devices, including electric guitars, transformers, microphones, and security systems.","{

OS_PH_HS_20_03_02,OS_PH_HS_20_03,OS_PH_HS_20,OS_PH_HS,Induced Electromotive Force,"Electromagnetic induction involves the generation of electromotive force (emf) in a conductor when exposed to changing magnetic fields. While initially misinterpreted as a force, emf actually represents the energy per unit charge added by a source, distinct from voltage which is the energy released per unit charge in a circuit. This phenomenon occurs when there's a change in the magnetic flux - the product of the magnetic field strength, area, and the cosine of the angle between the field and the surface normal vector.

The induced emf follows Faraday's law of induction, which states that the magnitude of emf is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through a conductor, with Lenz's law determining its direction. For a coil with N loops, the emf is proportional to the number of loops and the rate of change of the magnetic flux. According to Lenz's law, the induced current flows in a direction that creates a magnetic field opposing the change in magnetic flux, following the principle of energy conservation.","{

More precisely, we need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professorâ€™s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame.","{

Example- When a rocket expels gas at high speed in one direction (action), an equal and opposite force (thrust) is exerted on the rocket, pushing it forward. 
The thrust generated is:
F_thrust = m Ã— v_e

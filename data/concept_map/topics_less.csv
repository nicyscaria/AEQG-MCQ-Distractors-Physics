OS_PH_HS_02_01,OS_PH_HS_02,OS_PH_HS,"Relative Motion, Distance, and Displacement","Relative motion refers to the concept of observing the motion of an object from different reference frames or perspectives. The motion of an object is not absolute but is always described in relation to a chosen reference frame. For example, a car moving in a straight line might appear to be stationary to someone inside the car, but to an observer on the side of the road, the car is in motion.

Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to the total path length traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is always positive and does not consider the displacement direction.

Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to the straight-line distance between an object's initial and final positions, along with the direction of the path. Displacement accounts for both the magnitude and direction of motion.

In relative motion, the relative velocity between two objects is determined by the velocity of one object as observed from another. The principles of relative motion, distance, and displacement are essential for analyzing various real-world scenarios, such as the motion of vehicles, projectiles, and objects in a moving reference frame.","[

OS_PH_HS_02_02,OS_PH_HS_02,OS_PH_HS,Speed and Velocity,"Speed is a scalar quantity that refers to how fast an object is moving, regardless of the direction. It is the rate at which an object covers distance over time. Since speed does not have a direction, it is only concerned with the magnitude of motion.
Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it includes both the speed of an object and the direction in which it is moving. It describes the rate of change of an object's position in a specific direction. Unlike speed, velocity takes into account the direction of motion. An object can have a constant speed but a changing velocity if it changes direction, such as when moving in a circular path. Thus, velocity provides more detailed information about an object’s motion than speed.","[

OS_PH_HS_04_04,OS_PH_HS_04,OS_PH_HS,Newton's Third law of motion,"Newton’s third law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. Forces always occur in pairs, the two forces act in opposite directions and on different objects that's why don't get cancelled.

When an object rests on a surface, the surface applies a force on the object that opposes the weight of the object. This force acts perpendicular to the surface and is called the normal force.
The pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object.
Thrust is a force that pushes an object forward in response to the backward ejection of mass by the object. Rockets and airplanes are pushed forward by thrust.

Application of Newton's third law of motion
Forces are classified based on their source, transmission, or effects, such as push, weight, and friction. Newton’s third law helps us understand additional forces like the normal force, tension, and thrust. The gravitational force (or weight) acts everywhere on Earth, but objects do not constantly fall toward Earth’s center due to the normal force. The normal force is an outward force exerted by a surface perpendicular to it, preventing objects from penetrating the surface. On a horizontal surface, if the object is at rest and not accelerating, the normal force equals the weight (W =mg) but acts in the opposite direction. Tension, derived from the Latin word for ""stretch,"" is the pulling force transmitted along a flexible connector like a string, rope, or chain. It acts parallel to the connector’s length and in opposite directions at its ends due to a series of action-reaction forces.","[

Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation:
Newton’s law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This force acts along the line joining the centers of the two masses. Newton's formulation introduced the idea of a gravitational constant and allowed precise calculations of planetary orbits and interactions within the solar system.
Key Differences and Applications:
Newton’s law is accurate for most everyday and classical physics scenarios, such as predicting planetary orbits and satellite motion. However, general relativity is necessary for extreme conditions involving large masses, high velocities, or strong gravitational fields, such as black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology.
While Newton’s law provides an excellent approximation for most scenarios, general relativity offers a more complete and profound understanding of gravity, especially in extreme cosmic contexts.
